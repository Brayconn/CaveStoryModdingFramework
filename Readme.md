# Cave Story Modding Framework
A library for interfacing with every version of Cave Story.


# Building
It's just a regular Visual Studio solution file, it should build pretty normally.

Depends on these repos too:
- [PixelModdingFramework](https://github.com/Brayconn/PixelModdingFramework)
- [PETools](https://github.com/Brayconn/PETools) 
  - Make sure you use my overhaul, and not the original broken/super old parent repo.
